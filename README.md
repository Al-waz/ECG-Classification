### Patient ECG Classification
A tool-based classification system to predict cardiac diseases based on patient ECG data.

## Overview
This project involves developing a classification system that leverages ECG signal processing and deep learning models to identify and categorize cardiac diseases. 
The system processes patient ECG signals using High-pass filtering and the Pan-Tompkins algorithm before classifying arrhythmias with cutting-edge neural network architectures.

## Key Features
- *ECG Signal Processing:* Utilizes High-pass filtering to remove noise and the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to detect QRS complexes.
- *Cardiac Disease Classification:* Employs both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify irregularities.
- *Dataset:* Built and trained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset, ensuring robust and validated performance.
